# Biography

I am a senior undergraduate at [IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) studying Electrical Engineering and would be graduating July 2018. I am broadly interested in deep learning and its application in Computer Vision and NLP and the interplay between the two. During my time as an undergraduate I had I worked with [Prof. Yao Wang](engineering.nyu.edu/people/yao-wang) from [NYU](http://nyu.edu) on a couple of projects and had the fortune of visiting New York to work with her. I have also worked closely with [Prof. Tanaya Guha](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~tanaya). During my junior year, I enjoyed a stirring couple of months at [Artifacia](http://artifacia.com), an AI startup dealing with visual commerce. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in playing tennis, writing poetry and painting. I have been part of an initial stage startup called [MeetApp](fb.com/realmeetapp) and plan to start my own venture sometime down the line.
